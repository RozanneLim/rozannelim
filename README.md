## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rozanne Lim, welcome to my Github! I'm still learning the ins and outs of version control and data science (evidenced by my stats).
I'm currently a graduate student in the MHS Epidemiology program at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and I'm really interested in working with quantitative data, spatial analysis and injury prevention. Check out my website: https://rozannelim.github.io for more about me!
